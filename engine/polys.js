/* Polyfill for Atomics.waitAsync() for web browsers.
 *
 * Any kind of agent that is able to create a new Worker can use this polyfill.
 *
 * Load this file in all agents that will use Atomics.waitAsync.
 *
 * Agents that don't call Atomics.waitAsync need do nothing special.
 *
 * Any kind of agent can wake another agent that is sleeping in
 * Atomics.waitAsync by just calling Atomics.notify for the location being slept
 * on, as normal.
 *
 * The implementation is not completely faithful to the proposed semantics: in
 * the case where an agent first asyncWaits and then waits on the same location:
 * when it is woken, the two waits will be woken in order, while in the real
 * semantics, the sync wait will be woken first.
 *
 * In this polyfill Atomics.waitAsync is not very fast.
 */

/* Implementation:
 *
 * For every wait we fork off a Worker to perform the wait.  Workers are reused
 * when possible.  The worker communicates with its parent using postMessage.
 */
